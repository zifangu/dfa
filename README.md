# dfa
Class project from Theory of Computation

dfa.py will read in a text file called dfa.txt and construct a DFA. 

The structure of dfa.txt will be as follows:
 Line 1: the states of the DFA (separated by commas, if there is more than one state)
 Line 2: the alphabet of the DFA (separated by commas, if there is more than one symbol)
 Line 3: the starting state of the DFA
 Line 4: the final/accept states of the DFA (separated by commas, if there is more than one accept state)
 Line 5 and onward: the transition rules, where each rule takes the form a,b,c (where being in state a and reading symbol b transitions to new state c)
 
 input.txt contains strings on each line that will run on my dfa
